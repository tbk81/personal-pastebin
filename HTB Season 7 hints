Here are hints if anyone is struggling:
USER:
1. Check SMB share you will something (you can just unzip it and read xml) 

2. Abuse service named same as domain and get code execution (authenticate to this service as non domain user) 

3. Read some config files to get password 


ROOT:
1. DACL abuse 

2. ADCS abuse and you are admin
